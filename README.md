# The Unit Protocol

**The Unit** is a universal, immutable numerical constant (1.000000) used as a global standard for value — not a token, not an asset, and not owned by any government, company, or DAO.

## 🌐 Purpose

The Unit helps individuals, organizations, and applications:
- Compare value across borders and currencies
- Display economic activity in a common financial language
- Prevent distortion from inflation or speculative instruments
