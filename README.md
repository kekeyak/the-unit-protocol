# The Unit Protocol

**The Unit** is a universal, immutable numerical constant (1.000000) used as a global standard for value — not a token, not an asset, and not owned by any government, company, or DAO.

## 🌐 Purpose

The Unit helps individuals, organizations, and applications:
- Compare value across borders and currencies
- Display economic activity in a common financial language
- Prevent distortion from inflation or speculative instruments

## 🛠 Components

- 📖 `The_Unit_Whitepaper_FULL`  
- 🛡 `The_Unit_Foundation_Charter.md`  
- ⚖ `LICENSE` (AGPL v3.0 for all code; CC0 for concepts/text)

## 📜 Legal & Ethical Declaration

All materials in this repository are released as public goods under:

No one may enclose or tokenize The Unit. It is non-mintable, immutable, and open to all.
